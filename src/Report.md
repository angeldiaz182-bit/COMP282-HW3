Based on the ArrayList I think the complexity time of the Array list would be O(1) because most of the methods that are involved are O(1) although there is a couple that are O(n). However, the space complexity I assume would be O(n). The bench mark times from the array list how I saw it was that from 100K to 1M the times for the append was always increasing as N was starting to go up obviously with at 1M the append was at its highest time. The get times I saw they would increase but I noticed that when time would get to around the ten thousands it would sort of reset and go back to 1000s except at the end where it topped out at 29000. Some problems and difficulties that I encountered was definitely implementing the addAll method I sort of looked back at the add method that was already implemented the code and see how I could use that to sort of help me get started since I had a feeling it would be somewhat similar. Another thing that I had trouble with was the fail-fast semantics but that was more mainly because I never done them before so I did not have an idea where to really start or how to implement them and what was the purpose really behind them.
